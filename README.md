# [Elementary.audio](https://www.elementary.audio/) sample sequencing test

- hover or click sound-elements to hear sounds
  - when doing so, hear the sounds play once or looping
- record the trajectory of your hoverings / clicks and hear it play back
- add sequences and sounds to their timelines
  - evenly spaced by default but relative positions adjustable with offset sliders
  - global bpm and local bar resolution adjustable
